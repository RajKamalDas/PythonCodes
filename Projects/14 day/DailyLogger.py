Docstring for Projects.14 day.DailyLogger

What this is?: A program that gives a way to save/document/journal and see past entries.

How to use it?: Running the program, you are asked to choose whether you want to read, or write.

If you want to only read at a glance: Input “R”, or anything starting with it.
What will happen: You'll be shown the 3 most recent entries.
Example:
→   Would you like to
    Read (R)
    Write(W)
→   :Read   {← User Input}
→   In the past three days you have accomplished:
    Day:9 > [14 January 1902] > Things.
    Day:10 > [15 January 2026] > Nothing.
    Day:11 > [16 January 3902] > More Things.
→   {Exits}

If you want to insert a new entry: Input “W”, or anything starting with it.
What will happen: You'll see all the past entries, and then be asked for the entry.
⇒If you already added one entry today, then you'll not be asked for an entry.
Example #1:
→   Would you like to
    Read (R)
    Write(W)
→   :Write  {←User input}
→   {
        …
        All past entries
        …
    }
    What steps you took toady?
→   :Added Examples to the Docstring.   {←User input}
→   {Exits}

Example #2:
→   Would you like to
    Read (R)
    Write(W)
→   :Write  {←User input}
→   {
        …
        All past entries
        …
    }
→   Only one step a day, keep your mind out of the hay. Come back tomorrow, 👋🏽😊.
→   {Exits}
